TODO
	did Modify PubMedReportPullParser to just grab title and abstracts
	started Modify DocumentThread to gather JSON from spaCy then persist as gzip
	did Modify ParserThread for new results from pullparser
	Rewrite VagabondThread to feed Carrot2
	did Add SpaCyThread processing to DocumentThread
	did In ParserThread, add raw XML abstract to the JSONObject which then gets passed
		to DocumentThread
	In theory, SpaCyThread is close to right.
	SpaCyThread passes result to FileManager which persists clusters of 100 docs in gzip
		TODO drop that back to a dozen docs
